# Upload Panel

## What It Is

The file upload interface that slides open from the Upload Button. Users drag-and-drop or pick files, see upload progress per file, and handle files that need manual map placement (missing GPS).

## What It Looks Like

Slides down from Upload Button. Uses the shared `.ui-container` panel shell so outer radius, panel padding, and panel gap align with the Sidebar and Search Bar. Glassmorphic background (`--color-bg-surface` at 95% opacity + `backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`). Contains: header with title + close, a dashed drop zone, and a scrollable file list. Max height ~400px, scrolls internally.

## Where It Lives

- **Parent**: Upload Button Zone in `MapShellComponent`
- **Component**: `UploadPanelComponent` at `features/upload/upload-panel/`
- **Appears when**: Upload Button is toggled open

| --- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1   | Drags files onto Drop Zone   | Files added to queue, EXIF parsing starts               | Status → `parsing`                |
| 2   | Clicks Drop Zone             | Opens file picker dialog                                | Same as drag                      |
| 3   | Files have EXIF GPS          | Upload starts automatically (up to 3 parallel)          | Status → `uploading` → `complete` |
| 4   | File has no EXIF GPS         | Shows placement prompt, status = `awaiting_placement`   | Placement mode                    |
| 5   | Upload fails                 | Shows error message + Retry button on that file         | Status → `error`                  |
| 6   | Clicks Dismiss (×) on a file | Removes file from queue, revokes object URL             | File removed                      |
| 7   | Clicks Retry on failed file  | Re-attempts upload                                      | Status → `uploading`              |
| 8   | Upload succeeds              | Marker appears on map at EXIF/placed coordinates        | `imageUploaded` event             |
| 9   | All uploads complete         | Panel stays open showing results (user closes manually) | —                                 |

### File status colors

- Queued / parsing: neutral background
- Uploading: `--color-primary` progress bar
- Complete: subtle `--color-success` tint
- Error: subtle `--color-danger` tint
- Awaiting placement: `--color-warning` tint

| --------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Parsed EXIF     | `UploadService.parseExif()`    | `ParsedExif`               |
| Upload result   | `UploadService.uploadImage()`  | `{ imageId, storagePath }` |
| File validation | `UploadService.validateFile()` | `FileValidation`           |

## State

| Name       | Type                | Default | Controls                                     |

| `dragOver` | `boolean`           | `false` | Visual feedback on drag hover over drop zone |

Types: `FileUploadState` and `FileUploadStatus` are defined in the component file.

## Wiring

- Receives `[visible]` input from parent to control slide animation
- Emits `(imageUploaded)` with coordinates + image ID when upload completes
- Emits `(placementRequested)` when a file needs manual map placement
- Parent (`MapShellComponent`) handles placement mode and coordinates

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Slide-down animation from upload button
- [ ] Glassmorphic background with blur
- [ ] Uses `.ui-container` as the shared panel shell
- [x] Drag-and-drop works (visual feedback on drag-over)
- [x] Click on drop zone opens file picker
- [x] Per-file progress with status labels
- [x] Up to 3 parallel uploads
- [x] Failed files show Retry button
- [x] Missing-GPS files show placement prompt
- [x] Dismiss button removes file and revokes object URL
- [x] Accepted types: JPEG, PNG, HEIF/HEIC, WebP; max 25MB
- [x] New marker appears on map after successful upload
